## Fiber Optic Temperature Sensing System

The underground cable distributed fiber optic temperature measurement system utilizes advanced optoelectronic technology, communication technology, microprocessor technology, digital temperature sensing technology, and uniquely designed technology for operation in low temperature, high electric field, and humid environments. It can monitor temperatures in different environments separately, allowing for early detection of potential accidents and minimizing losses. Additionally, it provides a wealth of online monitoring data, offering a reliable basis for operators to fully understand the heating conditions of underground power cables. The mining distributed fiber optic sensing temperature analyzer is the core of the DTS (Distributed Temperature Sensing) system. The fiber optic temperature host is responsible for the entire system's signal collection, signal processing, data analysis, high-temperature alarms, and network transmission. It consists of an optical frequency generator, switching power supply, microprocessor, network interface, etc., serving as the core device for optoelectronic conversion and information processing.
