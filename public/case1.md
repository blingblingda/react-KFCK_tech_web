Abstract: This paper introduces the installation environment and operational calibration of the NGAM-2008 natural radioactive ash analyzer in the Daichi Dam coal preparation plant. It analyzes and evaluates the calibration data for production and the comparison data for ash content. The results show that the production measurement accuracy of the ash analyzer is better than 0.25%, and the ash content detection accuracy is 1.08%. The paper discusses the management and maintenance experience of the Daihe Dam coal preparation plant with respect to this natural radioactive ash analyzer and summarizes its features such as not using radioactive sources and having high measurement accuracy.

The Daihe Dam Coal Preparation Plant is located in Wangcang County, Sichuan Province, and is affiliated with the Chuanmei Group Guangwang Energy Company. This coal preparation plant is a group mine-type plant that started operation in 2015 with a designed production capacity of 1.50 million tons per year, primarily processing raw coal from three mines: Daihe Dam, Zhaojiaba, and Shidonggou [1]. Due to the high ash content and significant fluctuations in the selected raw coal, as well as its poor quality, the Daihe Dam Coal Preparation Plant decided to strictly control the original quality of the raw coal to ensure the maximization of the plant's economic benefits. For this purpose, they chose to use the NGAM-2008 natural radioactive (passive) ash analyzer for online detection of the ash content of incoming raw coal, facilitating internal assessments and settlements between the coal mines.

1. **The working principle and structural composition of the ash analyzer.**

   1.1 **Working Principle**

   In the natural world, substances commonly exhibit natural radioactivity, and coal is no exception. Trace amounts of natural radioactive elements such as 40K, Th series, and U series are mainly present in the ash content of coal. For a certain mass of coal, the magnitude of its natural radioactivity is positively correlated with the ash content. Taking the coal samples from the Daihe Dam Coal Preparation Plant as an example, the test results for ash content and natural radioactivity intensity are shown in Table 1. From Table 1, it is evident that as the ash content increases, the natural radioactivity intensity of the coal sample also increases continuously. Therefore, by calibrating the relationship between natural radioactivity intensity and ash content in advance, the ash content of coal can be determined using the measured natural radioactivity intensity [2-3]. Based on the principle of coal's natural radioactivity, the NGAM-2008 natural radioactive ash analyzer utilizes weak radioactive nuclear detection technology to achieve online measurement of coal ash content.

   (1) Natural Î³-ray Detector: In order to capture the weak natural gamma rays emitted by coal on the conveyor belt, the detector is installed below the conveyor belt. It has a large-sized measurement window containing a large volume of high-sensitivity scintillation crystal, resulting in high detection efficiency. It can achieve cross-sectional detection of coal flow, ensuring representative and accurate measurements.

   (2) Spectrum Analyzer: The spectrum analyzer analyzes the nuclear pulse signals transmitted by the radiation detector, performs multi-channel analysis, generates the energy spectrum curve of natural radiation, converts the collected field data into digital signals, and transmits them to the mainframe for analysis.

   (3) Environmental Radiation Shielding: The shielding material consists of lead alloy shielding plates and is installed above the coal conveyor belt. It shields noise signals from cosmic, wall, ground, and other environmental spaces, with a shielding rate exceeding 95%. This reduces background interference and improves the signal-to-noise ratio.

   (4) Load Weighing Device: The natural radioactivity intensity of coal is also related to the mass load of coal. Due to uneven changes in the coal flow load on the conveyor belt, a load weighing device is used for mass compensation. The load weighing device is designed to be integrated with the radiation detector, ensuring overlapping detection areas and improving measurement synchronization. It uses a fully suspended high-strength steel weighing bridge and 4 STC American Transcell weighing sensors, with a measurement accuracy better than 0.5 grade, capable of functioning as an electronic conveyor scale.

   (5) Mainframe: It employs a reliable IPC industrial computer running ash analyzer management software. The specific configuration includes an Intel Core i5 series CPU, 4GB of RAM, 1TB large storage capacity hard disk, dual network cards, a 22-inch monitor, and a MOXA communication card.

   (6) Ash Analysis Software: Based on a pre-established mathematical calculation model, it analyzes and calculates the raw data transmitted by the on-site instruments to derive real-time ash content, minute ash content, hour ash content, and other key information. It generates real-time and historical trend curves, creates reports, and facilitates user management.

2. **Installation Environment**

   A good and suitable installation environment is the prerequisite and guarantee for online instruments to achieve optimal measurement performance. Therefore, the Daihe Dam Coal Preparation Plant installed the NAGM-2008 natural radioactive ash analyzer on conveyor 805, which runs from transfer point 9 to the crasher room. Conveyor 805 is newly installed equipment in the coal preparation plant, characterized by good roller consistency and minimal vibration. The belt uses vulcanized joints, ensuring uniform quality, moderate tension, and less than 5% deviation. The ground is made of concrete, providing a solid and reliable base capable of supporting the weight of the ash analyzer's shielding material. Conveyor 805 has a suitable belt width (800mm), low belt speed (1.6 m/s), stable conveying capacity (300 t/h), and a flat horizontal profile, providing excellent measurement conditions for the natural radioactive ash analyzer.

   Since the NAGM-2008 natural radioactive ash analyzer does not use a radiation source and does not require approval from environmental protection departments, the installation process is convenient and quick. Installation work progresses at a rate of 2 hours per day, taking only 3 to 4 days to complete.

3. **Operation Evaluation**

   3.1 **Production Measurement Calibration**

   The Daichi Dam Coal Preparation Plant utilizes a ground scale weighing system and conducted two material tests to assess the cumulative production accuracy of the ash analyzer. The assessment results revealed that the cumulative production accuracy of the ash analyzer significantly surpassed the manufacturer's guaranteed 0.5% level and achieved the effect equivalent to a 0.25-grade conveyor scale.

   3.2 **Ash Content Measurement Calibration**

   On April 20, 2015, the Mining Bureau of Guangwang Group, along with the factory and mine, jointly organized a comparative experiment. Following the manual sampling method, they sampled, prepared, and tested the raw coal transported by conveyor 805, and recorded the measurements of the ash analyzer during this time period.

   Based on the evaluation method outlined in GB/T 19952-2005 "Performance Evaluation Method for Coal Online Analyzers," the calculated measurement accuracy (standard deviation) of the natural radioactive ash analyzer is 1.08%. This measurement accuracy meets the requirements specified in EJ/T 1078-1998 "Gamma Radiation Coal Ash Analyzer," which states that for ash content greater than 30%, the measurement accuracy should be less than 2.5% [6-9].

4. **Equipment Management and Maintenance**

   The NGAM-2008 natural radioactive ash analyzer can work well, and the daily management and maintenance by the users are crucial. The Daihe Dam Coal Preparation Plant follows the requirements of the ash analyzer manufacturer and combines its own characteristics to achieve the following points:

   (1) Designate coal quality personnel with computer and mechanical knowledge as the managers of the ash analyzer.

   (2) Arrange for managers to fully participate in equipment installation, commissioning, comparison, training, etc., to become familiar with the principles and performance of the equipment, be able to troubleshoot simple faults independently, and have the ability to calibrate the instrument independently.

   (3) Managers should adjust operation curves promptly according to changes in the types of coal entering the plant. Regularly sample the production coal flow, compare it with measurement values, and keep good records and accumulation of data to make minor adjustments to parameters for systematic biases.

   (4) The Mining Bureau of the group, the coal preparation plant, and the coal mine set a three-party password according to settlement characteristics to ensure the fair operation of the instrument and prevent human cheating behavior.

   (5) Maintenance personnel should clean the ash from the natural radioactive detector promptly during each shift, perform zero-point operations on the coal flow load detection device regularly, inspect the contact between rollers and belt conveyors in the weighing area to ensure no suspension, jamming, or overload occurs.
