## X-ray Online Ash Analyzer

**Working Principle**: X-rays are generated by high-speed electrons striking palladium metal and have a continuous spectrum property. Coal ash content has different attenuation absorption constants for X-rays of different energies. The measurement of ash content is realized based on the strong correlation between the attenuation absorption ratio of X-rays penetrating the coal stream to be measured and the coal ash content.

**Key Technology**: A high-sensitivity, high-detection efficiency, and high-resolution energy spectrum measurement system. The energy spectrum analysis system, which has independent intellectual property rights developed by Kaifeng Measurement & Control, has been applied in hundreds of engineering sites.

**Technical Features**:

- Utilizes multi-energy spectrum precise analysis technology to provide online real-time ash content measurement results of the conveyed coal stream, with high measurement accuracy, especially suitable for precise ash content measurement.
- Transmissive measurement through the coal stream, resulting in representative and highly credible detection results.
- The measurement value is independent of the type of coal measured, making it suitable for the measurement of ash content in various types of coal.
- Adapts to the thickness of the coal stream being measured without the need for additional thickness compensation measurement devices.
- Combines with belt samplers to achieve bypass measurement, creating ideal conditions for ash content detection.
- Exempt level, with the radiation dose at a distance of 5cm from the device surface being the same as the environmental background, i.e., radiation is undetectable, and the device produces no radiation when powered off, ensuring safety and pollution-free operation.

**Technical Specifications**:

- Power supply: AC220VÂ±20%, 50Hz;
- Power consumption of the measurement system: less than 50W;
- Installation method: bypass installation across the line in conjunction with the sampler;
- Coal particle size to be measured: less than 13mm (a crusher can be added to the sampler to achieve this);
- Ash content of coal to be measured: less than 60%;

**Measurement Accuracy**: 0.2%~0.3%
