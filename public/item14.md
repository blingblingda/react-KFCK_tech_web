## EST series protection devices

Substations are a critical component of the electrical power system and serve as an essential connection point within the power grid. Their primary function is to transform voltages, as well as to gather and distribute electrical energy. The normal operation of substations is crucial for the stability and safety of the electrical power system, highlighting the importance of monitoring and protecting these facilities. Conventional substations, especially those rated at 110kV and 35kV, play a significant role in urban, rural, and enterprise networks.

Implementing unmanned operations at these conventional substations is an effective strategy for power companies to reduce operational costs, improve labor productivity, and enhance safety and economic benefits. It also represents an advanced approach towards modernizing control and management levels within the electrical grid, aiming at the development goals and aspirations of modern grid operation management.

Over more than a decade, thorough research and understanding of electricity customer needs, combined with the successful experiences from domestic and international industry automation systems, have led to the development of a new generation of comprehensive substation automation system software platforms, the EST series protection devices, through technical innovation and the accumulation of many years of experience in power automation system development. This development is supported by advanced and reliable computer technologies and network communication technologies.

The device's general technical features include:

1. Utilization of a 32-bit high-speed DSP chip and a real-time multitasking operating system architecture, providing strong support for faster and more suitable protection algorithms.
2. Automatic compensation of sampling values through frequency tracking, using an automatic frequency tracking method to reduce measurement errors caused by frequency changes and ensure the accuracy of electrical parameter measurements unaffected by frequency variations.
3. High-speed 14-bit AD chips for precise data acquisition and harmonic analysis, with current and voltage measurement accuracy reaching 0.2 level, and power degree reaching 0.5 level. The device integrates an electricity metering function, achieving an accuracy of 0.5%.
4. Equipped with dual 485 communication ports and supporting the 103 serial communication protocol, facilitating network formation for users.
5. Featuring dual high-speed industrial Ethernet communication interfaces, effectively resolving all bottleneck issues in information interconnection, allowing for the instant transmission of a large amount of fault recording data to the master station.
6. Internal amplitude and phase relationship channels are clear and easy to read, aiding onsite construction personnel in verifying phase sequence and correct wiring, providing a reliable guarantee for accurate setting value input.
7. Multiple key operation modes and a 160\*80 large screen LCD display, eliminating the need to memorize operation commands and embodying a human-centric design philosophy for easier and more straightforward operation.
8. A rear-insertion, fully sealed, harsh environment-resistant chassis due to low power consumption, the chassis is fully sealed, significantly reducing the impact of dust, humidity, and harmful gases, coupled with a wide operating temperature range, making the device suitable for installation at control sites.
9. Electrostatic discharge immunity tested to GB/T 17626.2-1998 standard, achieving level 4 in electrostatic discharge immunity tests.
10. Radio-frequency electromagnetic field radiation immunity tested to GB/T 17626.3-1998 standard, achieving level 4 in radio-frequency electromagnetic field radiation immunity tests.
11. Electrical fast transient/burst immunity tested to GB/T 17626.4-1998 standard, achieving level 3 in electrical fast transient/burst immunity tests.
12. Surge immunity tested to GB/T 17626.5-1998 standard, achieving level 3 in surge immunity tests.
