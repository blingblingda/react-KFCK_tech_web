**Device Purpose:** This device is designed for the non-contact online detection of the areal density (weight per unit area) of lithium battery anode coatings.

**Measurement Principle:** Beta rays, being charged particle streams, undergo intensity attenuation when penetrating the coating of lithium battery anodes. This attenuation follows an exponential law and is related to the coating's areal density. The measurement of the coating's areal density is achieved by detecting the attenuation of the rays. Considering the structural form of the lithium battery anode material, the atomic coefficient of the material, and the range of areal densities, the device employs the beta radiation source Kr85.

**Device Features:**

- Patented radiation source protection device: The beta radiation source used is a Class V source, which poses a very low safety hazard. It features multi-material composite shielding protection, uses an electric gate valve to open and close the radiation, and the radiation dose meets environmental requirements (<1μSv/h). The protection device for this radiation source has obtained a national patent.
- Multiple specifications of radiation beams for user selection: Radiation beam sizes φ9.5mm, φ12mm, φ18mm, φ22mm are available, allowing users to choose according to their needs.
- Edge and end contour measurement function: A 3mm\*38mm micro-hole Kr85 radiation source is available for measuring the thinning areas on both sides of the anode coating and the contours of the start and end areas.
- Specialized beta ray detector: Features a special material window and a multi-layer electrode ionization chamber structure, providing high detection efficiency and stability. When using a radiation source with an activity of 0~2Ci, the ionization chamber operates in a high linear region without saturation causing non-linearity. The beta ray detector's ionization chamber is precision welded and sealed to ensure the core ionization chamber remains leak-free for 30 years.
- Closed-loop control function: Capable of connecting with the coating machine to achieve closed-loop control of the coating quality.
- Multi-frame isotopic measurement function: Supports connecting multiple measuring instruments for measurement along the same trajectory to obtain the net areal density of the coating.
