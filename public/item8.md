The ICS-DW type dual-scale frame combination belt scale installs two two-roller two-load cell floating scales on a single conveyor belt, forming A and B dual-unit scales. Both scale units share a single speed measurement device. This belt scale combines two units into a composite floating scale, characterized by a long measurement segment, good stability in measurement, and high precision. During regular operation, the two scale units can measure independently, and the belt scale's instrument real-time compares the measurement results. If data discrepancy is detected, an alert will prompt, allowing users to timely identify measurement faults. This type of belt scale is suitable for conveyor belts with a width of 800~1600mm and a belt speed of less than 3.15m/s, offering a measurement precision better than 0.5%.

The high-precision intelligent control belt scale is an innovative, modern belt scale that integrates high accuracy, intelligence, strong stability, and self-verification technology. It extensively employs dynamic weighing technology and multi-scale real-time verification technology, significantly improving the measurement accuracy and quality. Coupled with a smart control instrument independently developed specifically for high-precision belt scales, it ensures that the weighing accuracy remains stable at 0.25% for up to six months without maintenance.

Product Features: Multiple groups of scale frame combination structures; high-precision automatic counterweight verification technology; high-precision digital sensors; regular automatic verification; multi-scale intelligent real-time verification. The system boasts a fault-free operation cycle of â‰¥365 days. The automatic counterweight verification perfectly replaces manual physical verification. Depending on the conditions of the conveyor, the number of idlers varies from 12 to 24 sets, accommodating different belt widths, flow rates, and idler spacings, including conveyors with climbing radii.
