## Conveyor Intelligent Speed Control System

Belt conveyors are the main transportation equipment in coal mines and the throat of the mine production and transportation system. However, during the normal production process of the mine, due to the uneven distribution of coal seams in the mining area and the unbalanced coal mining volume, the mine's coal output is unstable, leading to phenomena such as no-load operation and fast rotation with less coal in the belt transportation system. This results in high energy consumption of the belt and low economic benefits.

**System Features:**

- Intelligent speed control based on coal volume monitoring
- Multilevel speed adjustment
- Accurate coal volume measurement
- Precise belt speed detection
- Constant flow operation under load
- Energy-saving operation under no-load and low-load conditions

**System Introduction: **

Belt conveyors are the main transportation equipment in coal mines and the throat of the mine production and transportation system. However, during the normal production process of the mine, due to the uneven distribution of coal seams in the mining area and the unbalanced coal mining volume, the mine's coal output becomes unstable, leading to phenomena such as no-load operation and fast rotation with less coal in the belt transportation system. This causes high energy consumption of the belt and low economic benefits. To improve the efficiency of belt conveyors, reduce equipment energy consumption and mechanical wear, and enhance the economic benefits of the mine, a belt conveyor intelligent speed control system is designed.

This system utilizes mine-used weighing measurement devices and mine-used speed sensors to obtain the coal carrying capacity and operational belt speed parameters of the belt conveyor. These parameters are collected and calculated by the smart mine-used control substation. Based on intelligent algorithms from fuzzy control and neural networks, it controls the operation of mine-used variable frequency drives. This achieves an automatic speed adjustment transport state of "start when loaded with coal, stop when empty, faster with more coal, slower with less coal," enhancing the level of mine intelligence. It achieves the goals of energy saving, consumption reduction, safety, and efficiency improvement.
