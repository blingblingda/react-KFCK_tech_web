## The Application of Natural Gamma Ray Ash Analyzers in the Raw Coal Detection of Handan Washing and Selection Plant

**Abstract:** This paper discusses the background, working principle, structure, and technical characteristics of the natural gamma ray ash analyzer. Through comparing the values obtained from manual sampling and analysis with those from the natural gamma ray ash analyzer, the application of this ash analyzer at the Handan washing and selection plant is analyzed. The on-site application demonstrates that under the premise of regular inspection, maintenance, comparison, and without considering external factors, the ash analyzer performs well and effectively meets the ash content detection requirements of different coal mines. It can improve detection efficiency, provide accurate data for production process control and coal washing operations in a timely manner, and has certain reference value for internal settlement within the enterprise. It also has reliable promotional value.

Handan Washing and Selection Plant is the first coal preparation plant in China designed independently. It was put into operation in 1959 and is located in the southwest of Handan City, under the jurisdiction of Fuxing District. It is a central-type coal washing plant with an annual processing capacity of 3.50 million tons. Currently, it mainly processes raw coal from three coal mines owned by Fengfeng Group: Wutongzhuang Mine, Niuerzhuang Mine, and Yangdong Mine.

Wutongzhuang Mine is located in the southeast of Fengfeng, with stable coal seams and produces high-quality and scarce coking coal. It has an annual output of about 2.6 million tons and is one of the main mines of Fengfeng Group. Yangdong Mine is located in the central-east part of Fengfeng, with multiple coal seams and highly unstable coal quality, producing various types of coal with an annual output of about 1.5 million tons, also being one of the main mines of Fengfeng Group. Niuerzhuang Mine is an older mine with relatively stable coal seams, producing lean coal with lower production capacity. The proportion of raw coal washed into Handan is relatively small, with an annual washing capacity of about 500,000 tons.

The coal ash content, which is an important indicator for evaluating coal quality and pricing in coal trade, cannot be burned and is a major target for reduction in coal washing and processing. The traditional method of ash content determination involves weighing a certain amount of air-dried coal sample, placing it in a muffle furnace, heating it at a certain rate to 815 ± 10°C until the ashing dish reaches a constant mass, and calculating the ash content based on the mass of the residue as a percentage of the coal sample mass. This method, even with rapid ashing, requires at least 3 hours from on-site wagon sampling, sample preparation, analysis to result reporting (60 minutes for analysis, closely related to sampling and unloading time), resulting in low efficiency and issues such as uneven loading, poor representativeness of top wagon sampling, and human errors, making it unable to accurately and timely detect coal quality, monitor coal washing, and achieve efficient production.

To meet the demand for rapid and online ash content measurement, and to achieve efficient production, the Handan Washing and Selection Plant installed a new NGAM-2008 gamma natural radiation online ash analyzer in April 2019 with strong support from the group company.

1. **The working principle of the NGAM-2008 natural online ash analyzer**

   1.1 **Ash Content Measurement Principle**

   Radioactive isotopes are widely present in nature, including coal, which contains a certain amount of natural radioactive elements (mainly potassium-40, uranium series, and thorium series). The mineral matter (ash content) in coal contains more natural radioactive elements compared to the organic matter (volatile matter). These natural radioactive elements can be seen as small radiation sources. For the same type of coal, the unit weight of natural radioactivity is positively correlated with the ash content of the coal. The ash content is directly proportional to the number of gamma (γ) particles emitted by the coal. The higher the ash content, the more gamma particles it emits. Therefore, by using a highly sensitive gamma ray detector to detect the gamma rays emitted by the coal flow on the conveyor belt, combined with a load weighing device to provide instantaneous load signals of the coal flow, and through a series of inverse calculations, the ash content in the coal flow can be calculated, achieving the purpose of online ash content detection.

   1.2 **Structure**

   The natural radiation ash content measurement system consists of a high-performance gamma ray detector, environmental radiation shielding, spectrometer, high-precision online load weighing device, and other measurement detection devices; as well as a mainframe computer, printer, and other display and processing equipment.

   (5) Full-range detection. It can detect the ash content signal and surface density sampling of the entire coal flow cross-section, making the ash content data more accurate and representative.

2. **Application Effect**

   From late April to May 2019, Handan Washing and Selection Plant conducted multiple batches, large quantities, and high-frequency manual sampling and analysis of the ash content of raw coal from three different mines: Wutongzhuang Mine, Yangdong Mine, and Niuerzhuang Mine. A large amount of data was accumulated, and a database of manual assay results for different mines entering the washing plant was established. Based on big data, suitable adjustments were made to the calibration coefficients of the mathematical model, and preliminary coefficients for the ash content of the three mines entering the washing plant were determined, entering the ash content measurement trial operation phase. In June 2019, the quality inspection workshop of Handan Washing and Selection Plant conducted daily comparisons of the ash content of raw coal from the three mines entering the plant with the results of manual assay to check their actual performance.

   Since the NAGM-2008 natural radioactive ash analyzer does not use a radiation source and does not require approval from environmental protection departments, the installation process is convenient and quick. Installation work progresses at a rate of 2 hours per day, taking only 3 to 4 days to complete.

   2.1 **Trial Data Analysis**

   Analysis of data from Handan Washing and Selection Plant, Wutongzhuang Mine, Yangdong Mine, and Niuerzhuang Mine is shown in the following form.

   2.2 **Application Analysis**

   The comparison results between the ash analyzer and manual sampling and analysis shown in the table indicate that there is a significant difference in values between the ash analyzer readings and manual assay values for individual batches, and there is no clear pattern to follow. However, this difference does not have a significant impact on the washed raw coal entering the washing and selection process. Only a few individual batch data points deviate significantly, and based on the trend of increase or decrease, coal blending can be adjusted reasonably to roughly control the variation in coal quality.

   From forms above, it can be observed that the weighted ash content differences for multiple batches in the first ten days are small, and the weighted ash content is within the error range. This can serve as a reference basis for ash content in the weekly settlement data for the plant and mines. To ensure that the ash analyzer readings are closer to the actual values, practical experience has shown that calibrating and verifying the ash analyzer for different mines every ten days can keep the differences typically within 1.5%. After multiple data weighting validations, the average deviation remains within the error range.

3. **Key Technologies and Innovations**

   Natural gamma-ray ash analyzers do not use radioactive sources, ensuring safety and environmental protection. The ash analyzer has established an effective mathematical model and can perform static calibration with belt stoppage safely and reliably.

4. **Benefit Evaluation**

   (1) **Economic Benefits:** After installing the non-radioactive ash analyzer, the labor intensity of workers has been reduced. Initially, the number of workers in the road transport team was reduced from 8 to 6 people. Calculated at an average monthly salary of 5000 yuan per person, the annual savings in wages for each person amount to 60,000 yuan, resulting in a total saving of 120,000 yuan for two people.

   (2) **Social Benefits:** The non-radioactive ash analyzer is a green, safe, environmentally friendly, and radiation-free product. It can provide timely and rapid guidance for coal washing production, adjust coal washing production parameters, and improve the clean coal recovery rate. It has good promotional value.

5. **Problems in Operation and Areas Needing Improvement**

   (1) Problem of switching coal types: The plant receives coal from three different mines, and often encounters situations where coal from different mines is transported to the bin at different times, shifts, or mine sources. If the operator forgets to switch the coal type, it will lead to a significant difference in ash content detected by the ash analyzer. Therefore, it is recommended to add a coal type switch reminder signal to avoid data errors caused by forgetting to switch coal types.

   (2) Data loss due to power outage: If the ash analyzer experiences an unexpected power outage, data will be lost, causing difficulties in guiding production and settlement between enterprises and mines. It is suggested to add memory function components to prevent data loss due to power outages.

   (3) Impact of changes in mine coal seam blending ratio: In the process, when coal from multiple working faces in the mine is mixed and sent to the plant for ash analysis, there is a large discrepancy between the ash content detected by the ash analyzer and the manual sampling and analysis. It is necessary for the mine to fix the blending ratio of different coal seams. Due to the significant difference in the radioactive element content of coal from different working faces, attention must be paid to the blending ratio of the mine. For example, when the mine changes to a more distant working face or the blending ratio of the working face changes, it is necessary to conduct manual material composition analysis of the raw coal and recalibrate the ash analyzer in a timely manner.

   (4) Problem of no data display due to multiple router connections: Initially, the plant's fiber optic connection to the upper computer and display was far away, and there were three routers in between, which often led to no data display. Later, after moving the upper computer and display from the operation room to the fiber optic access point, the disconnection problem was effectively avoided, ensuring the accuracy, timeliness, and completeness of data detection.

   (5) Increase in fluctuation range of detection values: When the thickness of pollutants such as coal dust on the outer shell of the online ash analyzer detector reaches 1 mm or more, it will affect the detection performance. Therefore, it is necessary to regularly clean pollutants and coal dust based on environmental conditions. Initial cleaning is recommended once a week, and in good conditions, cleaning once a month is also acceptable. However, regular checks must be carried out, and zeroing of the ash analyzer scale must be done. Initially, daily zeroing checks are required.

   (6) Impact of mixed coal on measurement accuracy: Once the incoming raw coal is mixed in the coal bin, it leads to inaccurate measurement values. It is necessary to clean the coal belt of the receiving coal pit each time before unloading coal from another mine to avoid cross-contamination between different mine sources.

   (7) Impact of inaccurate belt scale on ash content detection values: It is necessary to regularly check whether the screws of the belt scale frame are loose, whether the weighing roller is dirty or not in contact with the belt. Lubricate the weighing rollers regularly and check if the belt is misaligned. Regular cross-checks are required. If significant deviations in data are found, adjust the relevant parameters promptly.

   (8) Impact of changes in raw coal particle size on detection values: When there are significant changes in the particle size of raw coal, there will be a large discrepancy between the detection values of the ash analyzer and the actual values.

   (9) Impact of uneven coal loading on detection values: When the coal loading on the belt fluctuates significantly, causing intermittent coal flow or uneven coal thickness on the belt, it affects the accuracy of ash measurement, resulting in a large deviation between detection values and actual values. Therefore, the coal feeding machine on the belt should be adjusted to ensure a stable coal loading and avoid interference from this factor.

   (10) Impact of lack of operation records after switching coal types on detection values: If the operator has switched coal types but there are no operation records, the ash content value will be the ash content value of mixed coal types, resulting in an error in ash content detection values.
