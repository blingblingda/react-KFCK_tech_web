## Electrical Fire Monitoring System

The electrical fire monitoring system in distribution rooms prevents early-stage electrical fires and issues alarms by collecting and monitoring signals of residual current, overcurrent, overvoltage, contact temperature, cable temperature, and fault arc. When necessary, it can also interlock to disconnect distribution circuits that have been detected with excessive residual current, temperature, and fault arcs.
