## Mine Access Control System

The ZKM12 Mine Access Control System is primarily installed in the transformer substations or pump station rooms of coal mines, serving as an access control and door status monitoring system for the explosion-proof doors of these substations or pump rooms. It mainly consists of an underground access controller, entrance card reader, electric lock, door magnet, switch power supply, and ID/IC induction cards, along with a computer host, management software, and card issuer located above ground. The underground access controller connects to the above-ground computer host via Ethernet for communication. Under normal operating conditions, only the underground components are needed to form the access control device. The above-ground computer host is only required for remote control and real-time status monitoring. It enables functionalities such as remote door opening calls, local IC card door opening, facial recognition door opening, iris recognition door opening, and fingerprint recognition door opening.
