## The Application of Aassive Online Ash Analyzer in the Detection of Raw Coal in Huaibei Mining

**Abstract:** Discussing the background, ash measurement principle, and structure of online ash analyzers, explaining their applicability in various mines in the Huaibei mining industry, and combining the on-site performance to analyze the static calibration method, its main influencing factors, and common issues. Under standardized usage, online ash analyzers can measure specific coal types to improve detection efficiency, provide references for quality control in production processes, and have certain reference value for internal settlement in mining plants. However, further improvements are needed in applicability and ash measurement accuracy to expand their scope and meet on-site requirements.

Ash content detection is an important means of quality control for coal products. After manual sampling, the ash content is detected using the combustion method, which often leads to delayed guidance for coal compartmentalization. Additionally, due to production constraints, some coal preparation plants face drawbacks in manual sampling such as high labor requirements, poor representativeness of samples, and high labor intensity. To address these issues, in conjunction with research on the application of online ash analyzers in coal preparation plants, the Huaibei Mining Group conducted investigations into various coal detection methods. Based on the coal quality characteristics in the mining area, since 2015, they have extensively adopted passive online ash analyzers for real-time detection of washed raw coal.

1. **The principle and structure of passive online ash analyzer**

   (1) Principle: The passive online ash analyzer does not use a radioactive source. Instead, it measures the natural γ-rays emitted by the coal's own radioactive elements, such as potassium, thorium, and rubidium. By correlating these γ-rays with the ash content and combining them with weight measurements, the analyzer performs real-time ash content estimation through data filtering and fitting.

   (2) Structure: The passive online ash analyzer is composed of a γ-ray detector, environmental radiation shielding body, spectrum analyzer, electronic belt scale, and other measurement and detection devices.

2. **The applicability of passive online ash analyzers to Huaibei Mining**

Before the online ash analyzer was put into use, Huainan Mining entrusted relevant institutions to conduct natural radioactivity laboratory evaluations on the 15 pairs of coal samples from the mines planned to be tested by the online ash analyzer. The natural radioactivity of coal in the Huainan mining area was measured to be between 120 cps and 350 cps. Moreover, as the ash content increased, the cps value also increased, indicating that the natural radioactivity of coal in the Huainan mining area could be measured by a passive online ash analyzer. During the installation of the online ash analyzer, the γ radiation level of the background environment in the ash analyzer installation area should be measured to prepare for the removal of environmental radiation interference in the later stages. There were significant differences in the background environmental γ radiation levels among the various mines under the Huainan mining area.

3. **Calibration of the passive online ash analyzer**

After the installation of the passive online ash analyzer, it should first undergo static calibration to detect the natural γ-ray levels corresponding to different amounts of coal with the same ash content. This serves as a reference basis for actual measurements in the later stages. In practical applications, curves are established for each mine in the Huainan mining area based on the radioactive characteristics of coal from different mines, which are then matched during detection.

When calibrating the ash analyzer statically, the calibration coal used must be of the same type as the coal to be tested. In practice, it has been observed that in mines where multiple working faces produce coal simultaneously, the use of passive ash analyzers for mixed raw coal entering the washery often results in significant discrepancies with manually sampled and tested coal. This kind of error is challenging to eliminate by simply adjusting related parameters. For such mines, using calibration coal prepared in proportion to the production from each working face significantly reduces the error values.

The reason behind this is the variation in radioactive elements in coal from working faces that are located far apart. Therefore, when there are significant changes in the distance between working faces or in the proportion of coal extracted from each face within a mine, it is necessary to resample the raw coal and perform static calibration of the ash analyzer again. To further improve measurement accuracy, it is important to conduct sampling comparisons after static calibration, observe the deviation between the ash analyzer's measurements and laboratory test results, and make appropriate adjustments to the ash content parameters.

4. **Field Application Effects of Passive Online Ash Analyzer**

The passive online ash analyzer was put into trial operation in Luling Coal Preparation Plant in 2015, and its test results served as a reference for internal settlement between mining plants. It has now been used in ash content detection of raw coal entering the washing plants for all coking coal and thermal coal preparation plants in Huaibei. Particularly in the central coal preparation plant, each online ash analyzer is responsible for detecting the raw coal from multiple mines.

To ensure the effectiveness of the passive online ash analyzer, Huaibei Mining Industry periodically organizes manual sampling to compare the ash content. Taking the 2115 belt ash analyzer in the Guobei Coal Preparation Plant in June 2018 as an example, the belt width of the ash analyzer is 1,400 mm, belt speed is 2.5 m/s, and coal throughput is 1,200 t/h. Six batches of raw coal from Wobei Mine were randomly sampled for comparison.

Comparison between the ash analyzer measurement values and manual sampling results shows a significant deviation between individual batches, without clear trends or patterns. However, for the raw coal used in the washing process, these values are sufficient for guiding the raw coal allocation and roughly controlling the quality. In terms of settlement assessments between mining plants, it is observed that as the time span increases, the differences in the weighted average ash content for multiple batches are not significant. This can already be used as a reference for ash content settlement between mining plants. Through practical exploration, it has been found that using the weighted average ash content values for every half month or for more than 20 batches as a reference for plant settlement results in differences typically within 1.5%. These values have been validated multiple times through the weighted back-calculation of the final products in coal preparation plants, and the errors remain within a reasonable range.

5. **Analysis of Common Issues with Passive Ash Analyzers**

   (1) Abnormal measurement data: During normal fluctuations in ash content, there are instances where the absolute values of individual batch measurements abnormally increase and then return to the normal fluctuation range. For example, in Wubei Mine of Huaibei Mining Group, during thunderstorm weather, there are occasional abnormal increases in ash content when using the ash analyzer. This is speculated to be related to the inert gases contained in the local soil, as the concentration of inert gases increases in thunderstorm weather, leading to higher ash content measurements by the analyzer. Corresponding solutions include increasing detection instruments to monitor abnormal environments, automatically adjusting relevant parameters during calculations, implementing real-time compensation, and automatic calibration.

   (2) Increased fluctuation in measurement values: The online ash analyzer detects the ash content of coal based on the intensity of gamma rays emitted by the coal itself. Accumulation of coal dust and other pollutants on the outer shell of the gamma ray detector is an important factor affecting detection performance. Therefore, regular cleaning is necessary to minimize the impact. The frequency of cleaning depends on the conditions of use (such as conveyor belt conditions, dust levels, etc.) and can be adjusted accordingly. In severe cases, cleaning may be required once per shift, while in better conditions, monthly cleaning may suffice. However, regular inspections are essential. Additionally, the accuracy of the weighing device and factors such as coal looseness, thickness, particle size, and moisture content directly affect the accuracy of ash content measurement. The weighing device should be calibrated regularly, especially during the initial installation phase where zero-point calibration should be done daily and range adjustment monthly. Proper adjustment of the feed rate of the conveyor belt feeder is also necessary to maintain uniform coal thickness as much as possible.

   (3) Poor Computing and Processing Capability. Hardware issues such as damage to the spectrometer or inaccuracies in the detector, as well as software problems like data loss due to insufficient storage capacity and failure to automatically clear outdated data, can lead to system crashes and subsequent data loss with prolonged operation time. Additionally, unexpected power outages can also result in data loss. Furthermore, during online operation, the data acquisition and upload software lacks the ability to resume interrupted uploads, and there is no warning system for interruptions or abnormal ash values. After network or software interruptions are resolved, the system does not automatically upload any pending data. Therefore, the industrial computer accompanying the ash analyzer should be configured appropriately based on the volume of measurement data. It is recommended that for newly installed ash analyzers, the CPU model of the industrial computer should not be lower than i5, with a dedicated graphics card of at least 2 GB, a minimum of 4 GB RAM, and a hard drive capacity of at least 2 TB. The accuracy standards of all detection devices should be improved, and software functionalities should be redesigned to meet on-site requirements.

   (4) Influence of Mixed Coal on Measurement Values. This influence can be categorized into two situations: ① Inconsistency between the proportions of the measured coal and the coal used for static calibration, which requires attention to the mining area's blending ratios and static calibration. ② Distortion in measurements caused by mixed unloading and blending of incoming coal at the plant, which necessitates ensuring the bottom compartment of the coal pit is cleared to prevent cross-contamination between different mines and coal types.

   (5) Impact of Human Factors. These human factors mainly involve profit-driven interference between mining plants. To prevent data tampering, measures can be taken from adjusting the ash analyzer parameters, involving joint calibration by the mining company, plant, and measuring station, and implementing password segmentation methods. Furthermore, if one ash analyzer measures multiple mines' raw coal, incorrect selection of measurement benchmarks and incomplete measurement processes can also lead to distorted results, requiring corresponding management systems to minimize human factors' impact.

   (6) Ash Measurement Accuracy Issues. In recent years, various ash measurement technologies have emerged, such as active dual γ-ray, neutron activation, X-ray, and laser analysis, all of which require further improvement in accuracy. Based on field experience, natural radiation ash analyzers should be improved in at least three aspects: ① Enhancing analysis speed and capability to adapt to uneven coal thickness and frequent particle size changes to ensure measurement accuracy. ② Providing timely warnings or algorithm improvements for automatic compensation and correction when there is a significant difference between the measured mixed coal and the statically calibrated coal samples. ③ Enhancing adaptability to meet different measurement needs under various on-site conditions. For example, in cases of multiple measurements of the same batch of coal, the system should automatically identify and perform weighted data processing.
