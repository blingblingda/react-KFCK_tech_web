The system consists of an industrial control host, a communication transmission interface for coal mines, a communication line lightning arrester, mine explosion-proof ash content sensors for coal (two for each monitoring point), cesium-137 and americium-241 radiation sources, an explosion-proof and intrinsically safe isolator, an intrinsically safe liquid crystal display, a mine explosion-proof and intrinsically safe type power supply, etc.

It employs dual detectors: Independent gamma ray detectors are used for Cs137 and Am241, with a special design that completely eliminates the error caused by the Compton effect in the low energy segment for Cs137 and Am241.

High-speed multi-channel data acquisition: A 4096-channel data collector with a rate of 500Ksps and a 12-bit ADC, with an error of ±1LSB. The collector's design is simple and rational, conforming to electromagnetic compatibility principles, with extensive use of SMT components.

Intelligent integrated detector: The field detector contains an intelligent lower computer, capable of real-time data collection and processing on-site, with a permanent memory function.

Two-wire communication: Various data from all monitoring points can be transmitted to the control room computer via a pair of communication buses (telephone lines), with one host supporting up to 8 monitoring points and a total communication distance of up to 30km, or through an underground ring network.

Comprehensive reporting: Capable of generating ash content reports for 3 minutes, 10 minutes, 1 hour, shift, day, and month.

Network configuration software: Uses a network version of industrial configuration software, equipped with OPC software interface and network functionality.

The system and its main equipment all have coal safety certificates and explosion-proof certification.

Ash measurement accuracy: ≤15% ash content, better than ±0.5%; 15%～ 30% ash content, better than ±1.0%; 30%～ 50% ash content, better than ±2.0%;

Standards implemented: EJ/T1078-1998 GB3836-2000
