## VIS Intelligent Dry Sorting Machine

The VIS series intelligent dry sorting machine is independently developed by Kaifeng Measurement & Control for coal intelligent online sorting systems. This system is based on machine vision principles, utilizing advanced AI deep learning algorithms for precise classification of coal and gangue, combined with pneumatic jet technology to achieve efficient separation. The system operates without water consumption, radiation-free, and environmentally friendly, accommodating a wide range of raw coal particle sizes.

**System Features**:

1. Sorting based on machine vision principles, radiation-free, without the need for complex shielding, safe and environmentally friendly;
2. No thickness limit for coal lump recognition, adaptable to a wide range of particle sizes: 30~1000mm;
3. Big data, deep self-learning, continuously self-correcting, precise sorting;
4. Capable of sorting coal from gangue and gangue from coal, with a flexible switching mechanism;
5. Able to identify and eject miscellaneous objects such as anchor rods and wooden blocks;
6. Low overall investment cost, rapid construction, and low operating expenses.

**System Parameters**:

1. Sorting granularity: 1000~30mm;
2. Belt feeder width: 800~2400mm;
3. Processing capacity: 50t/h~300t/h;
4. Sorting scheme: Coal from gangue / Gangue from coal;
5. Gangue with coal rate: Less than 5%.
