**System Overview**

The ICS series electronic belt scale system is a new generation of bulk material dynamic online weighing system developed by our company. This system integrates multiple functions such as dynamic weighing, continuous measurement, real-time monitoring, production management, and data publication. The on-site weighing components of the system have a simple structure, respond quickly to stress, are plug-and-play, require minimal maintenance, and their measuring components have extremely high measurement linearity and accuracy. They also demonstrate excellent long-term stability and repeatability, ensuring high precision for continuous online weighing.

Among them, the ICS-ST mining electronic belt scale has passed the inspection and certification of the National Safety Mark Center for Mining Products, obtaining a mining product safety mark certificate (Safety Mark Number: MFC080023) and an explosion-proof certificate for related components. It can be installed and used in mines and other places with explosive atmospheres (methane) and coal dust where explosion-proof requirements are necessary.

**System Composition**

The system consists of a host computer located in the monitoring room or dispatch room, metering software, communication transmission interface, and belt scale body, weighing sensors, signal amplifier, LCD display, etc., installed on-site at the belt conveyor. The system uses bus-type data transmission and can be configured according to actual needs into a configuration with one host and multiple scale bodies, flexibly forming an online weighing measurement system.

**System Features and Characteristics**

1. Online weighing and cumulative measurement with a precision grade ranging from 0.125 to 1.0, depending on the weighing bridge structure and environmental conditions.
2. Real-time monitoring of the status of each conveyor belt: Displays whether the belt is unloaded or loaded, material flow, material compliance, belt speed, cumulative amount, and other parameters in an intuitive manner using numbers, curves, and histograms for clear visibility at a glance.
3. The system has extensive records of historical data, including real-time data, historical data, work records, and fault records, all of which are searchable and printable. This facilitates maintenance and assessment of the conveyor system's operation by users.
4. Independent measurement for each on-site scale body with real-time data protection. Data is not lost during power outages and accumulates continuously after power is restored.
5. The system host can communicate with each on-site scale body using existing two-core telephone lines to form a baseband bus transmission network, or it can connect to a gigabit/10-gigabit ring network built in mines, enabling data upload. The maximum distance for baseband bus data transmission is 10km.
6. The system features web publishing and mobile app capabilities, allowing sharing of relevant measurement data to the internal LAN or transmission to leaders' mobile devices. It supports multi-password hierarchical permissions for data viewing, enabling leaders to stay informed about production status at any time.
7. Both the software and hardware of the system have the capability for expansion, allowing future additional weighing scale bodies to be integrated into the existing measurement system without the need for extra hosts or other equipment.

The ICS-DW type dual-scale frame combination belt scale installs two floating balance scales, each with two supporting rollers and two weighing sensors, on a single conveyor belt, forming A and B dual scale units. Both scale bodies share one speed measuring device. As a combined suspension scale with two units paired together, it features a long measurement segment, good stability in measurement, and high accuracy. During regular operation, each scale body can independently measure, and the belt scale instrument compares the measurement results in real time. If data discrepancies are detected, an alarm will prompt, facilitating timely detection of measurement faults by users. This type of belt scale is suitable for belt conveyors with a width of 800~1600mm, a belt speed of up to 3.15m/s, and offers a measurement accuracy better than 0.5%.

**ICS-GZ High Precision Matrix Smart Belt Scale**

The high-precision intelligent control belt scale is an innovative, modern belt scale that integrates high precision, intelligence, strong stability, and self-calibration technology. It fully utilizes dynamic weighing technology and multi-scale real-time verification technology, significantly improving measurement accuracy and ensuring long-term stable accuracy of 0.25% with up to six months of maintenance-free operation.

**Product Features**: Multi-group scale frame modular structure; high-precision automatic weight calibration technology; high-precision digital sensors; regular automatic calibration; multi-scale intelligent real-time verification. The fault-free operation period is â‰¥365 days. Automatic weight calibration can perfectly replace manual physical calibration. Depending on the conditions of the conveyor, such as the quality of the conveyor and the number of rollers, there are 12-24 sets of rollers. It is adaptable to different bandwidths, flow rates, roller spacing, and can also be used on conveyors with climbing arcs.
