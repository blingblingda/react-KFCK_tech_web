**Equipment Purpose**: This device is used for the non-contact online detection of the coating density (weight per unit area) of the cathode coating of lithium batteries.

**Measurement Principle**: X-rays are a type of electromagnetic wave. When X-rays penetrate the cathode coating of a lithium battery, their intensity attenuates according to an exponential law, which is related to the coating density. The measurement of coating density is achieved based on the attenuation of detected rays. Cathode materials such as lithium cobaltate, lithium manganate, lithium iron phosphate, and ternary materials have high equivalent atomic numbers compared to the aluminum foil substrate, resulting in a higher absorption coefficient for X-rays. Therefore, normal fluctuations in the substrate have minimal impact on the measurement results.

**Equipment Features**:

1. **Small Spot Size**: The physical size of the spot ranges in various specifications, such as 6mm*6mm, 6mm*9mm, 6mm\*12mm, etc., offering high spatial resolution capabilities. Fluctuations in the electrode sheet have no impact on the measurements.
2. **Optimized Measurement Realization**: The X-ray machine’s tube voltage and current can be adjusted according to the specific specifications of the cathode coating, constructing optimized measurement conditions.
3. **Unique Long-Life Design**: The X-ray generator employs soft start-up upon powering, dual 24-bit ADC dual independent closed-loop control, and oil immersion air cooling techniques to protect the core component, the X-ray tube, from aging for 10 years. The detector uses precision welding and sealing processes to ensure the core ionization chamber remains leak-free for 30 years.
4. **High-Precision O-type Scanning Frame**: Utilizes a high inertial moment steel structure thick-walled tube beam for the overall scanning O-type frame. The scanning base surface is processed in one positioning by a CNC center, achieving high positional accuracy and strong overall stability. This design has been patented.
5. **Continuous Calibration Device**: The measurement device is equipped with a calibration device, allowing for convenient online calibration without stopping the machine, which has been patented.
6. **Exemption-Level Protection**: The dose rate does not exceed 1μSv/h at a distance of 10cm from the equipment surface.
7. **Closed-Loop Control Function**: Capable of integrating with the coating machine to achieve closed-loop control of coating quality.
8. **Multi-frame Co-location Measurement Function**: Supports multi-frame measurement devices working together to track and measure along the same trajectory, obtaining the net coating density.
