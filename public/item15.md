## Remote Monitoring System

The coal production ash content remote monitoring system transmits the weighing signal to the controller via a carrier installed on coal mine transport equipment. The controller completes signal processing and computation to derive production data. Real-time ash content of coal is detected by an online ash meter installed on the belt conveyor. The data is then uploaded to the data server through remote communication technology (Ethernet or mobile communication network (GPRS)). The data monitoring terminal accesses the data server to achieve real-time monitoring of production data.

The coal monitoring system's technical indicators fully comply with the national "General Technical Standards for Remote Monitoring Systems of Coal Production" requirements.

- Intelligent, capable of real-time automatic monitoring of enterprise coal with an accuracy of 0.5 level.

- The metering equipment used in the system has obtained national coal safety certification and explosion-proof certification.

- Equipped with various communication interfaces, allowing for the selection of optimized networking methods based on on-site conditions at enterprises:

  Ethernet LAN, modems, RS-485, CAN, Modbus, etc., facilitating easy integration with various monitoring systems. Communication rates can be set from 1200b/s to 9600b/s.

- Anti-cheating technology in metering data processing, automatic alarming, effectively preventing manual cheating.

- Mature, stable, and safe highly integrated functions ensure the system's long-term stable operation.

- Unattended operation and automatic alarming.

- Networking modes:

  - Direct Ethernet access: Metering devices are equipped with Ethernet interfaces and can be directly connected to the existing enterprise local area network without the need for a transition through the safety monitoring system.
  - Transition through the safety monitoring system: Can be connected to major domestic safety monitoring systems, such as Chang'an Company, Xian Island, Honeywell, Changzhou Institute, Chongqing Branch, etc.
  - GPRS wireless communication mode: GPRS is a new mobile data communication service that provides a connection between mobile users and data networks, offering high-speed wireless IP services to mobile users or enabling the uploading of metering data through a GPRS transmission module.
